## Platforms

We utilize the following platforms & Third Party Services to make this project possible:

| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Platform | Description                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [Discord](https://www.discord.com/) | Discord is Voice, Video, and Text Chat for Gamers, Communities, and Friends.  It runs on Mac, Linux, Windows, and all commonly used mobile platforms. Its based on the electrum platform, and primarily angular.js client side, with its server components running in many different languages. |
| [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs) | A powerful JavaScript library for interacting with the Discord API.  Create reliable cross-platform, reliable Discord bots with our npm package, 100% API coverage, and the compatibility and platform agnosticity you would strongly expect from a javascript library. | 
| [E621](https://www.e621.net/) | E621 is a mature furry-owned and operated image board replacement for the image board Sidechan.  E621 runs off of the Ouroboros platform, a danbooru-style software specifically designed for the site.  Tthe site is named for the compound "monosodium glutamate", whose E Number is E621.  It is in fact entirely open source, and runs on ruby on rails. |
| [FurAffinity](https://www.furaffinity.com/) | Fur Affinity, also known as FA or FurAffinity, is the furry fandom's largest online community, focusing on the promotion of art, music and stories.  The site was created in 2005 by Alkora as an alternative to various art community websites such as SheezyArt and DeviantArt.  It has since expanded, recieved many upgrades and survived the test of time as a core source of furry-related content.  It runs in php, javascript client-side, and is traditionally database backended.  It holds the appeal of being compatible no matter where its being accessed from, but as a result it lacks more modern features, like a standard API protocol. |
| [Rule34](https://rule34.paheal.net/) | Based upon the legend of Rule #34 of the Internet as established by 4chan:  "If it exists, there is porn of it.  No exceptions."  The furry version's often referred to by its host domain Paheal (to distinguish it from a different website,  rule34.com and rule34.xxx which is a 302 alias to the same -- whose founding community wasn't furry centric, but embraces its existance as a part of this rule).  Paheal is a "furrderated"  incantation that more welcomingly accepts copyrighted furry content without passing it formal dismissal as a technical part of rule 34.  It is an imageboard based on the Danbooru concept. As the "successor" of Yiff.tk, a former furry imageboard,  its new incarnation hosts Rule 34 versions of most mainstream and/or copyrighted media containing anthropomorphic characters.  It runs on Danbooru software which is open source, and on ruby on rails. |
| [inkbunny](https://www.inkbunny.com) | Inkbunny is a community art site catering to adult furry fans.  Inkbunny exists to help artists share and sell their work.  It also provides a public distrobution platform for them to do the same, along the same token as DeviantArt, but explicitly for furries.  Inkbunny welcomes furries with various interests, fetishes, and 'philias.  It, like furaffinity, runs on proprietary php software, traditionally backed by database.  |

> ‚öñÔ∏è We access said platforms to the legal tune of what is considered publically available, falls under fair-use as content anyone can access, copy, or download and share for educational and entertainment purposes, and make best effort to act within what is considered reasonable,  acceptable, non-malicious automated use of the involved platform.  This is made appearent by our transparency in providing our source code to the public.

> ‚≠ê For those platforms that enforce Credit Where its Due, our bot links the original posting to aide in promoting interest in the creator of the work, and page where applicable of the artist(s) involved, in every case.

> üîç We are dependent upon the entered accuracy of citation data coming from all third parties.  In some cases, it may not be completely accurate, as all of this data is still at the end of the day contributed by people not under our jurisdiction of management or responsibility as a downstream content service provider.  As a result, we cannot accept any willful intent or claim to misrepresent any person, entity, or organization that states it is the creator.  We are very far downstream, and thus this is very difficult to enforce every single time someone runs a command.  For any of these types of complaints of misrepresentation or where a citation appears incorrectly, we suggest you take it up with the page author who entered the data.  Thank you for your understanding and your cooperation!
