# Making Contributions

## Preface and notices

In making contributions to this repository, you agree to conduct yourself in complaicne with the terms of these guidelines. 

> ❓ **When does Trust and Safety get involved?**  Discord upholds or urgency to contact trust and safety via its inclusion of Third Party Services (us) in its binding User Agreement where are obligated by agreement to practively make effort to cease, document, and report such severe incidents to discord.

> ❓ **Will I be notified if such reporting needs to happen?**  Yes.  Discord obligates us to report to our users, as well as Discord if compromise to user accounts, private information or data leakage has occoured.  This includes how much data in summary, when the incident occoured, whom was compromised, and what they can do to protect themselves/we can due to ensure that it does not continue to occour.

Here are those rules that keep us safe as your maintainers, as well as you as our volunteer contributors, and ultimately end-users:

## Guideliens

Following are the contribution guidelines that form the body of this document.  You **must agree** in whole to follow these rules when making a contribution in any form or format to this project.  It is assumed that you have **read**, **understand**, and **agree** to these guidelines when you submit your contirbution to this project.

1.  Conduct yourself in a professional, appropriate, logical, and ethical manner when participating in the effort of contribution.

2.  Discrimination in any form when creating or maintaining a contribution is stricly prohibited.

> ❓ Discrimination comes in many forms.  Here are just a few examples:  age, biological gender, gender of identification, sexual identity, race, age, language, culture, nationality, marital status, financial status, social status, disability, lifestyle choice, kink or fetish, etc.  All forms including those not mentioned, are prohibited.

3.  Attempting to include malware in our publically available source code is prohibited.  Either:

 - directly, by including malicious code in your contribution
 - indirectly through obfuscated means, via malicious links that download malicious content, or phishing contexts that collect unnessecary amounts of user information.

4.  Including or promoting content through your contribution that violates the [Discord Developer Acceptable Use Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy) & [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) - for example:

 - Including features that compromise the personally held security of the end-user, and compromise or mangle the exchange of data between the bot and the Discord API.
 - Removing safety filters, ratelimiting, and security protection features that are included to uphold and protect Discord's content sharing guidelines for end user access, such as publically distrobuting a production version of the bot that does not actively block cub porn or shotacon (explicitly banned in the Discord Community Guidelines), or distrobuting a production version of the bot that doesn't refuse to post NSFW content in a channel not marked "Adult".

5.  Adding features that include unsolicited advertisements made to users.

   DM advertisements containing ads or promotions, unless the user elects to recieve this type of information (they **must** run a command to do so) are prohibited.
 
   __Examples to Clarify:__

   > ✅ Improving the feature to get information about the bot, or ask the bot how to contribute by running a command, such as improving upon ``/contribute``, ``/info``, or ``/status``,  is acceptable form of advertising the bot as the user asked for this information directly.
   > ❌ Creating a worker that randomly DMs users and encourages them to add the bot to their server, is **not** acceptable.

 6.  Adding features that demand donations or subscription fees for the use of any feature, or locks any feature behind a paywall or "Premium Subscription Fee", and attempting to commit those features back here.
 
 > ❓ What if I'd like to monetize a feature:  You can't.  This action is prohibited in any downstream release candidates or forks.  That's stealing, my dude!

## Disciplinary Action

 Failure to follow these guidelines when submitting an issue, offering a pull request, or corresponding on this repository, the support server, or to any of its involved project contributors or volunteers,  will result in disciplinary action which may include any or all of:

- The denial of contributions effort by a rejection or deletion of your contribution
- Denial of future contribution effort depending on the nature and the circumstances by inclusion in the workflows blacklist that protects this repository against naughty, awful, bad people uwu.
- Removal from the support community which surrounds the bot.
- Being blocked and getting to deal with Clyde instead of us (oh no!)
- Trust and Safety report of the incident to Discord itself by our team with your identifying information.  This is reserved for cases that typically involve platform security compromises and user privacy right violations.

## Revocation

Revocation of contribution agreement does not apply and carries forward with any contributions you make, as they become permenant once your changes have been merged into our production branch (here, that's **master**).  All contributors will be notified of changes to this document, all have a say on improving it as our contributing volunteer team, with respect to best community interest.
