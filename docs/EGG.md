## "ham_sandwich"?

We banned ourselves from ham sandwich day so you won't have to.  Ham is by far the most basic and popular "surplus" meat at the delicatesson, anyway.  If you've ordered a ham sandwhich, its probably your "first time".  :|

## Are you ready to give up?

...or are you thirsty for more?

We ran out of syrup.  Please stop.

## cheese grater?

Don't ask, don't tell.  We don't want to relive the incident in attempting to explain this.  Life's never the same on the other side of the crippling PTSD this incident generated.  Thank you for cxoming to my TED talk.

## Awoo

There's an really good legendary Discord secret that lets you have any role on the server, just type ``/ban @me`` and see what that does. 

Don't tel nobody about it, ok?  If it didn't work, yoou have to press ALT + F4 a couple of times instead, on your mac that's going to be option + space + period, right.  Right.  

Don't tell anyone about this.
