I'm providing NSFW Furry images from different websites.

# Important Things

_Because those are the only questions you'll ever ask when adding a bot._

## ❓ What does this bot do?

 FurExplicitBot provides images from:

- e621
- FurAffinity
- InkBunny
- rule34

Allowing them to be shared on Discord!  We also included features like:

- Filtering out gross, shocking (ewww) and inappropriate (>.<) content by default that is not safe for Discord
- Allowing NSFW (adult) content to be shared in channels that have been marked as such.
- Autoposting feature to turn a channel into a rolling feed of fresh content!
- Reverse image search feature that tries to identify artists of work, and credit them \*(1)

> \*(1) ⚠️ This feature is still experimental and is our 'best effort' to include.  It may not always be truthful due to the autommated nature of making such a determination, and on some platforms, entry of that cross reference information by a person.  We always recommend that you double-check cross-references the bot provides for accuracy and do not place 100% of such a determination in what it provides.  We strive for accuracy, but cannot ulatimately gaurentee 100% as this also is a third-party feature we don't regulate or moderate.
